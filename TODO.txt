Things to consider when adjusting the scale of the canvas drawing:

* All new doodles should created using the global scale factor.
  * (DONE) This is done by using the doodle.setScaleLevel(level) method
* All doodles already added should be set to use the new scale level, and canvas should be repainted
  * (DONE) This is done by looping through existing doodles (this.doodleArray) and
  setting the level using doodle.setScaleLevel(level) and then repainting the canvas.
* MOVING: Ranges are used to determine valid doodle positions. Mostly we can integrate the scale
  level by adjusting the constrain() method.
  * Moving range:
    * Move:
      * doodle.snapToGrid UNCHANGED - might have to be adjusted
      * doodle.snapToQuadrant UNCHANGED - don't need to adjust
      * doodle.snapToPoints UNCHANGED - don't need to adjust
      * Bounds are enforced correctly by constraining the range within doodle.move.
  * ED.Mode.Scale:
    * (DONE): need to take into account scale level when constraining the scale range
  * Rotation:
    * (DONE): no need to add scale level when constraining the range.
  * ED.Model.Arc:
    * (DONE): no need to
  * ED.Mode.Rotate:
    * (DONE). Tested with ACIOL. No change required.
  * ED.Mode.Apex
    * (DONE). Tested with AntSeg. No change required.
  * ED.Mode.Size
    * (DONE). Tested with Patch. No change required (uses range.constrain());
  * ED.Mode.Handles
    * (DONE). Tested with PeripapillaryAtrophy. No changed required (uses range.constrain());
